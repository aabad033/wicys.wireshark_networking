# Wireshark & Networking Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to the **Wireshark and Networking Workshop**. This session is designed to bridge the gap between abstract networking theory and the actual data moving across your wire [cite: 1, 13]. By the end of this workshop, you will understand how computers "speak" to each other and how to use industry-standard tools to eavesdrop on those conversations [cite: 3, 7].

### 🎯 Workshop Purpose
The goal of this workshop is to provide a hands-on introduction to:
* **Networking Basics**: Understanding how devices exchange data [cite: 2].
* **The 5-Layer Model**: Breaking down the standards that make global communication possible [cite: 4].
* **Packet Analysis**: Using Wireshark to capture, filter, and inspect live traffic [cite: 7, 13].
