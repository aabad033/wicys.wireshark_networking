# Wireshark & Networking Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to the **Wireshark and Networking Workshop**. [cite_start]This session is designed to bridge the gap between abstract networking theory and the actual data moving across your wire[cite: 1, 13]. [cite_start]By the end of this workshop, you will understand how computers "speak" to each other and how to use industry-standard tools to eavesdrop on those conversations[cite: 3, 7].

### 🎯 Workshop Purpose

* [cite_start]**Networking Basics**: Understanding how devices exchange data[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**The 5-Layer Model**: Breaking down the standards that make global communication possible[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]**Packet Analysis**: Using Wireshark to capture, filter, and inspect live traffic[cite: 7, 13].
